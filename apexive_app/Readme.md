## Blog Models:

**1. Author Model:**
● Represents information about authors.
● Fields:
    ● `name`: CharField for the author's name.
    ● `email`: EmailField for the author's email address (unique).
    ● `bio`: TextField for the author's biography.
● `__str__` method: Returns the author's name when the object is printed.

**2. Tag Model:**
● Represents tags associated with blog posts.
● Fields:
    ● `name`: CharField for the tag name (unique).
● `__str__` method: Returns the tag name when the object is printed.

**3. Post Model:**
● Represents individual blog posts.
● Fields:
    ● `title`: CharField for the post title.
    ● `content`: TextField for the post content.
    ● `pub_date`: DateTimeField for the publication date (auto_now_add is set to True, meaning it's set automatically when the post is created).
    ● `author`: ForeignKey linking to the Author model, establishing a many-to-one relationship between authors and posts.
    ● `tags`: ManyToManyField for associating tags with blog posts.
● `__str__` method: Returns the post title when the object is printed.

## E-commerce Models:

**1. Manufacturer Model:**
● Represents manufacturers of products.
● Fields:
    ● `name`: CharField for the manufacturer's name (unique).
    ● `location`: CharField for the manufacturer's location.
● `__str__` method: Returns the manufacturer's name when the object is printed.

**2. Category Model:**
● Represents product categories.
● Fields:
    ● `name`: CharField for the category name (unique).
● `__str__` method: Returns the category name when the object is printed.

**3. Product Model:**
● Represents individual products.
● Fields:
    ● `name`: CharField for the product name.
    ● `description`: TextField for the product description.
    ● `price`: DecimalField for the product price.
    ● `manufacturer`: ForeignKey linking to the Manufacturer model, establishing a many-to-one relationship between manufacturers and products.
    ● `categories`: ManyToManyField for associating categories with products.
`__str__` method: Returns the product name when the object is printed.


## Common Patterns:

● **ForeignKey and ManyToManyField:**
● ForeignKey is used to establish many-to-one relationships between models (e.g., `Post` and `Author`).
ManyToManyField is used for many-to-many relationships (e.g., `Post` and `Tag`, `Product` and `Category`).
● `__str__` Method:

● The `__str__` method is defined for each model to provide a human-readable representation when objects are printed.



⇨ These models follow Django best practices, utilizing various field types, relationships, and methods to represent the data structure of a blog and an e-commerce application. The use of ForeignKey and ManyToManyField demonstrates the normalization of data to avoid redundancy and maintain data integrity.
